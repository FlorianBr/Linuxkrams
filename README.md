# Conky

My conky scripts. On all of my machines I use six panels on the bottom left of my monitor to display data:

 1. Generic info, system and GPU RAM
 2. Partition usage and root IO graph
 3. CPU overall and core graphs
 4. Fan speeds and temperatures
 5. Network infos
 6. Processes

# KODI

Stuff for my Raspberry Pi running KODI. Probably deprecated because I haven't used it in a while, I mostly use a Nvidia Shield now.

# MQTT

Scripts to grab data from different sources and publish it on my local MQTT broker. Mostly for creating fancy graphs with Grafana or for home automation stuff.

Currently with scripts for:

- Diesel price
- ETF prices
- Local ethernet traffic
- Fritzbox WAN traffic
- Current water level
- Current weather

# Munin

Scripts for Munin. Probably deprecated, I havent used munin in a while

# Squid

Scripts for Squid proxy to filter spam and update filter lists. Probably deprecated, I replaced squid with PiHole

# Tracker

Old scripts for tracking my phone. Very hacky, no real security whatsoever. I replaced it long ago with nextclouds phonetrack

# XPlanet

Scripts and config to render xplanet on the desktop background with current light and cloud maps

# ZSH

My zsh settings. Incomplete and WIP
